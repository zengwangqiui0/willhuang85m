#### Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.  We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.

_(feel free to suggest things)_
